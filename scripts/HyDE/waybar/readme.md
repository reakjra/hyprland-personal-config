# ðŸŒ¸ Waybar (HyDE) ðŸŒ¸

> I think HyDE uses `~/.local/share/waybar/layouts/hyprdots` to save waybar's configurations, so back it up there your own. 
Furthermore, keep mind the CSS is personalized through the theme, Es. `Kuroi Hana/Configs/.configs/hyde/themes/Kuroi Hana/waybar.theme`. And, to update everything, use waybar.py command in the terminal, particularly waybar.py -G to update the `include.json` files to add a customized .jsonc from `~/.local/share/waybar/modules`.
For a dropdown menu it uses XML, which can be added to `~/.local/share/waybar/menus`


## ðŸŒ¸ Files
> `reakjra.jsonc`. This one modules the waybar's look, like pills, icons, etc. etc. This goes in:
```sh
~/.local/share/waybar/layouts/hyprdots/<reakjra.jsonc>
```
