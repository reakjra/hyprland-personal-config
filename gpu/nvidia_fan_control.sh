# --- Configuration ---
# Define your fan curve (temperature: fan_speed_percentage)
# Example: 40C at 30%, 50C at 40%, etc.
FAN_CURVE=(
    "40:30"   # Up to 40C, 30% fan speed
    "50:40"   # Up to 50C, 40% fan speed
    "60:50"   # Up to 60C, 60% fan speed
    "70:65"   # Up to 70C, 65% fan speed
    "75:70"   # Up to 75C, 70% fan speed
    "80:75"   # Up to 80C, 750% fan speed
    "90:100"  # Above 90C, 100% fan speed
)
INTERVAL_SECONDS=5 # How often to check temperature (in seconds)

# --- Important Prerequisites (READ CAREFULLY!) ---
# 1. Ensure NVIDIA Proprietary Drivers are installed.
# 2. Set 'Coolbits "31"' in your xorg.conf file (e.g., /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-nvidia.conf).
#    Example content for 20-nvidia.conf:
#    Section "Device"
#        Identifier "Nvidia Card"
#        Driver     "nvidia"
#        VendorName "NVIDIA Corporation"
#        Option     "Coolbits" "31"
#    EndSection
# 3. REBOOT your system after setting Coolbits for changes to take effect.
# 4. This script uses 'sudo' for nvidia-settings.
#    - For manual testing, you'll need to run 'xhost +si:localuser:root' in your terminal first.
#    - For autostart (exec-once in Hyprland), Polkit (pkexec) is generally more robust
#      or you can configure passwordless sudo for nvidia-settings (less secure, use with caution).
#      (The script uses the 'sudo env ...' method which often requires xhost or pkexec setup)
