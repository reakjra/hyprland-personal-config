I think HyDE uses ~/.local/share/waybar/layouts/hyprdots to save waybar's configurations, so back it up there your own. 
Furthermore, keep mind the CSS is personalized through the theme, Es. Kuroi Hana/Configs/,configs/hyde/themes/Kuroi Hana/waybar.theme. And, to update everything, use waybar.py command in the terminal, particularly waybar.py -G to update the include.json files to add a customized .jsonc from ~/.local/share/waybar/modules
